This is our ZITADEL [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) template. It shows how to authenticate as a user and show user information.

You can read the quickstart in our [Documentation](https://docs.zitadel.com/docs/examples/login/vue)

## Getting Started

To run the example run

```bash
npm install
```

and then

```bash
npm run dev
```

Make sure to replace the environement in auth.ts with your own config.

If you run into issues, contact us or raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel).
